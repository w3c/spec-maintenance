# spec-maintenance

Here we coordinate efforts on long-term, ongoing maintenance of specs published by the W3C and related orgs — and for some web features that yet lack any spec at all.
See also https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Specs/todo.

## Problem

Some key web specs lack active maintenance. And some web features have no spec at all. Problems caused by those facts include:

- significant pain/frustration/trouble for implementors trying to implement web features/specs
- problems such as lack of interoperability among implementations
- pain/frustration/trouble for web developers trying to develop content using those features/specs

<details>
  <summary>General problem</summary>

  Across all the organizations that are creating and publishing specs for the web platform, we need to be putting more discipline into creating more systematic ways to support and encourage ongoing maintenance of proper specs for web features — including features that are implemented but not even properly specified yet at all.

  We need to be burning down more technical debt — rather than just focusing almost all energy on creating yet more new specs/features for whatever the shiniest new thing is at the moment. (And then over time just ending up neglecting those too — after the major engines all have implementations and the feature is not the new and shiny any longer.)

## Specs

See https://github.com/w3c/spec-maintenance/wiki/Spec-list for a list of some specs/needs that have been identified as current priorities.
